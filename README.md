Welcome to WiziCost !

It is a 52hours-hackathon project which consists in an interactive form to simulate a price (false one for development) of a resource that could propose a farmer to another one, in a spirit of mutual aid.

*git clone the project

*run yarn encore dev
*run symfony server:start
*Enjoy !
